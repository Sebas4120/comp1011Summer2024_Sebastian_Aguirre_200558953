    Data that is generated on the spot
        Manually create stream
        Tranform any collection data type (except Maps) to a stream
        Streams temp data => executed/actions ONCE


    Categories of Stream

            IntStream
            LongStream
            DoubleStream

        Reference Streams
            Any reference data type

Lambda
    Functions NOT attached to a class
    Attached to data source? Stream or event listening thread

        blocked: user-input
        wait

Using the Random Object & knowledge of Streams and Lambda

Create a series (stream) of Student objects
Student class should have studentId => random number between 1000 and 9999
                          first name
                          last name
                          age => random value between 18 and 65
                          grade => random value between 20-100

Output all Failing students
Output all Mature students (30+)
Output all Honor Roll Students between 18 and 25
